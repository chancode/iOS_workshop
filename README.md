# iOS_workshop
iOS workshop of January 16th, 2016

## PURPOSE:
This iOS workshop is for beginners and provides a "hands-on" approach to discover how to build iOS applications. 
Goals are : 
- discover the XCode IDE, 
- play a bit with UI construction using the XcodeInterfaceBuilder tool, 
- introduce some key concepts and design patterns on the iOS SDK, 
- start coding and pluging elements together to build an app. 

## EXERCICES:
Exercices are of progressive difficulty. 
Exercice 01 : Check prerequisites, start a simple empty app, exploire the Xcode IDE and Simulator. 
Exercice 02 : Add a button, hook a alert popup, introduction to MVC pattern.
Exercice 03 : Improve UI easily using NSConstraints
Exercice 04 : Continue on MVC pattern, understand the view hierarchy, implement a delegate pattern to push a view and close it back.
